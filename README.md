# Marketing Insights For A Beverage Brand
 The project is about an imaginary beverage company called CodeX.
 CodeX is a German beverage company which is recently launched in India. They launched their
 energy drink in 10 cities in India.CodeX surveyed those 10 cities and received results from 10k
 respondents. The survey was based on consumer behavior questions like their purchasing
 habits, feedback about the market's available energy drinks, pricing, packaging, etc. Their
 Marketing Team wants the Data Analyst to convert these survey results into meaningful insights which
 the team can use to drive actions.The Marketing Team has asked to share certain insights.

 ## Here are the questions I was interested in answering
1) What demographic factors, such as age and gender, are most influential in the consumption of energy drinks, and how do they vary across the 10 surveyed cities?
2) How effective are different marketing channels, particularly online ads, in reaching various demographic segments, and what impact do these channels have on brand awareness and sales?
3) Which ingredients (e.g., caffeine, vitamins) and packaging styles (e.g., sleek and portable cans) are most preferred by different age groups and genders, and how can this preference be leveraged in product development?
4) What are the key factors that contribute to Cola Coka's market leadership and strong brand reputation, and how can CodeX use these insights to enhance its competitive positioning?
5) How does brand reputation influence purchasing decisions among different demographic groups, and what strategies can CodeX implement to build and maintain a strong brand reputation in the Indian market?

## I took the following steps to create my analysis
1) Retrieved data from Excel files containing relevant information.
2) Ensured data integrity by cleaning and preparing it for analysis, removing any inconsistencies or errors.
3) Identified and established essential KPIs crucial for performance evaluation.
4) Developed charts and visual representations to effectively communicate insights derived from the data.
5) Implemented slicers to enable dynamic filtering and exploration of data.
6) Constructed a comprehensive dashboard integrating all components for easy monitoring and analysis.

## Here are my key takeaways
1) 60% of respondents were male, highlighting a robust male preference for energy drinks.
2) Over 50% of participants were aged 19-30, emphasizing the product's appeal to the youth.
3) Online ads emerged as the most potent channel for reaching a broad audience, particularly among the youth.
4) Caffeine and vitamins were the go-to ingredients, while sleek and portable cans won in the packaging department.
5) Cola Coka established itself as the market leader, with a considerable fan following.
6) Brand reputation played a critical role in consumer decision-making.
